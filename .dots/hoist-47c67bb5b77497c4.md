File: src/backends/aarch64/lower.zig lowerBranch() function. Replace stub with: if inst_data is .jump: (1) Get target block from JumpData, (2) Get VCode block label for target, (3) Emit b (unconditional branch) instruction, (4) Return true. Import JumpData. ~20 lines. Depends on: hoist-47c67b59311e0c33.
