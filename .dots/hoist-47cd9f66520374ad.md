COMPLETED SESSION (b78af82): Implemented all remaining simple ISLE constructors in 6 commits: (1) USHLL/SSHLL widening loads (968ac08), (2) Store ops istore8/16/32+vstr (9c496c5), (3) Vector narrow/load snarrow/unarrow/uunarrow/vldr (1c5b5e1), (4) Special register access FP/SP/LR/pinned (f4a056d), (5) Debug trap (b78af82). All extern constructors in lower.isle now implemented. Remaining work is infrastructure: constant pool, ABI, regalloc, jump tables.
