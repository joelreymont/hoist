File: src/backends/aarch64/lower.isle, isle_helpers.zig - Need to understand how to emit multi-inst sequences (FCMP + B.cond + BRK) for fcvt bounds checks - Cranelift uses with_flags/ConsumesFlags pattern - Check if we have similar infrastructure or need simpler approach - Reference: Cranelift aarch64/inst.isle fpu_to_int_cvt
