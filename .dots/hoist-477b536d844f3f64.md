File: src/ir/verifier.zig - Add validation: lane count/width compatibility (widening: output width = 2×input, narrowing: input width = 2×output), vector element type constraints, extract_vector lane bounds - Accept: Verifier catches invalid vector ops - Depends: 'Add SIMD vector InstructionData variants'
