File: src/backends/aarch64/isa.zig and src/codegen/lower_aarch64.zig. Add use_pac(), use_bti() flags to ISA settings. Emit BTI instructions (BTI c/j/jc) at function entry points for indirect call targets. Add PAC signing (PACIASP) in prologue and authentication (AUTIASP) before RET for return address protection. Required for hardened binaries on modern ARM64 (macOS 11+, Linux with PAC). Dependencies: ISA feature flags, prologue/epilogue. Effort: 2-3 days.
