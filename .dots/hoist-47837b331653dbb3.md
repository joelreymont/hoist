File: src/backends/aarch64/inst.zig - Need to add: ADDS/SUBS/ANDS (flag-setting ALU ops), CSET (conditional set), CMEQ0 (compare equal to zero), UMAXP (unsigned max pairwise) - These are prerequisites for: overflow arithmetic, vany_true/vall_true - Each is ~20-30 LOC: instruction struct, format method, constructor helper - Accept: Instructions compile and have basic tests
