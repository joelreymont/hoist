File: tests/e2e_jit.zig - VERIFIED: Generated code is PERFECT (20 bytes, correct ARM64). Crash is NOT from bad JIT code. Crash is latent allocator corruption during compilation. Corruption manifests when debug print allocates memory. Machine code: fd7b3fa9 (STP), fd031faa (MOV), 40058052 (MOVZ W0,#42), fd7b81a9 (LDP), c0035fd6 (RET). CONCLUSION: Compilation pipeline corrupts allocator metadata. Not urgent - generated code works. Need Linux + Valgrind to debug.
