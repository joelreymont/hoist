Test compilation still has many errors in codegen/opts files and IR tests. Main compilation (zig build) passes. Major remaining issues: RegClass enum mismatch, test_runner module structure changes, Signature.init error union changes, PrimaryMap.getOrDefault removed, domtree/loops API changes. Many of these are in optimization passes which may not be priority.
