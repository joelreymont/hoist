File: src/ir/builder.zig (NEW) - Need builder API to create new instructions in optimization passes - Required for: division-by-constant, SCCP, alias analysis transforms - Pattern: builder.imul(dividend, magic_const), builder.ushr(result, shift_amt) - Accept: Can construct IR sequences programmatically
