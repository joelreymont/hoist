File: src/backends/aarch64/lower_e2e_test.zig (~150 lines). Build simple IR function (iconst, iadd, return), lower to VCode using Aarch64Lower.backend(), verify: (1) VCode has expected instruction count, (2) Instructions are correct types (movz, add_rr, ret), (3) Virtual registers allocated. Uses FunctionBuilder to construct IR. Depends on: hoist-47c67c25dcb01ded.
