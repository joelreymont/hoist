File: src/codegen/lower_aarch64.zig. Lower fcvt_* IR opcodes for FP type conversions (f32↔f64, int↔float). Implement FCVT, SCVTF, UCVTF, FCVTZS, FCVTZU instructions. Handle all size combinations. Reference: Cranelift lower.isle conversion patterns. Part of Phase 2 core functionality. Estimate: 1 day.
