Hoist x64 lowering is stubbed (src/backends/x64/lower.zig:12-46) and always returns false. Cranelift lowering uses ISLE glue in ~/Work/wasmtime/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/lower.rs:1-120 and x64/lower.isle. Root cause: missing ISLE-generated lowering and glue code. Fix: port lower.isle + generated constructors/extractors, hook LowerCtx emit, and map IR ops to x64 Inst variants.
