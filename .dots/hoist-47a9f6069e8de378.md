File: tests/integration/aarch64_integration_tests.zig. Full pipeline tests: IR → lowering → regalloc → encoding → JIT execution → verify result. Test small functions (factorial, fibonacci, arithmetic, branches). Verify correctness. Setup execution harness (mmap, mprotect, function pointer call). Effort: 5-10 days.
