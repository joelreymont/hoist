File: tests/e2e_jit.zig:294 - Multiply test compiles and executes but returns 0 instead of expected result. Possible issues: (1) ABI parameter passing not working (MOV from x0/x1 to vregs), (2) multiply instruction not executing, (3) return value not moved to x0, or (4) register allocation broken. Need to debug generated machine code or add logging to trace execution.
