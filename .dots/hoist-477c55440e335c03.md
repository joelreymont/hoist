File: src/codegen/opts/sccp.zig (new) - Infrastructure READY: CFG (cfg.zig:369 LOC), dataflow via DFG (dfg.zig:19424 LOC) - Need: Value lattice (Bottom/Constant/Top), SSA constant folding (~400-500 LOC) - Pattern: Similar to GVN (gvn.zig:283 LOC) but with lattice worklist - Register in PassManager (optimize.zig:63) - Accept: Propagates constants through conditionals
