File: src/backends/aarch64/emission_test.zig (~100 lines). Test VCode → machine code emission. Create simple VCode sequences with known encoding → emit → verify bytes. Test: simple mov, add imm, ret sequence. Uses emit() directly with mock output buffer. Verifies instruction layout and encoding correctness.
