File: src/generated/aarch64_lower_generated.zig add to .call switch
Opcode: call
Need: Lower call using ABI for argument placement
Implementation (~150 lines): Get callee signature, use ABI to determine arg locations (regs vs stack), emit moves to place args, emit bl instruction, emit moves to retrieve return values
Dependencies: All emit dots (needs working prologue/epilogue)
Estimated: 3 days
Test: Test call with various signatures
