File: src/codegen/lower_aarch64.zig. Lower br_table IR opcode to jump table sequence: bounds check, load table entry, indirect branch. Emit jump table data in constant pool. Handle out-of-bounds default case. Reference: Cranelift lower.isle br_table patterns. Part of Phase 2 advanced control flow. Estimate: 2 days.
