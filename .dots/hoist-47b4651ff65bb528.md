File: src/regalloc/liveness.zig - Implement computeLiveness(func) -> LivenessInfo. Single forward pass through instructions: on first def of vreg, create range with start=inst_idx. On each use, update range.end_inst=inst_idx. Simple intra-block analysis (no CFG). Dependencies: hoist-47b464cbac33aee0.
