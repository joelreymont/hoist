Hoist x64 emitter is minimal and explicitly missing ModR/M+SIB+REX+VEX/addressing modes (src/backends/x64/emit.zig:11-16). Cranelift emitter is in ~/Work/wasmtime/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/inst/emit.rs:1-80. Root cause: full encoder not ported. Fix: implement ModR/M+SIB encodings, REX/VEX prefixes, relocations/label uses, and cover new Inst variants.
