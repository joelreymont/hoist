File: src/backends/aarch64/lower_e2e_test.zig - End-to-end lowering tests from IR opcodes to machine instructions. Test: 1) iconst → mov_imm, 2) iadd → add_rr, 3) load/store → ldr/str, 4) call → bl, 5) tls_value → mrs+add, 6) dynamic_stack_addr → add X19. Snapshot expected instruction sequences. Verify register allocation produces valid code.
