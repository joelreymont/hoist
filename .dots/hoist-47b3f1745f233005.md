File: src/codegen/compile.zig:627-666 - iconst is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED with basic mov_imm. However, needs enhancement for large immediates that can't be encoded. Should check if immediate fits in logical immediate or mov_imm encoding, otherwise use MOVZ/MOVK sequence (see dot hoist-47a97f538667f023). P1 operation.
