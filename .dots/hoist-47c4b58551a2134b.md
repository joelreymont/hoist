File: src/backends/aarch64/abi.zig or compile.zig - Add infrastructure for tracking dynamic stack pointer across function. Need: 1) Allocate callee-save register (X19-X28) or frame slot for dyn_sp, 2) Initialize dyn_sp = SP at function entry, 3) Update dyn_sp when dynamic allocations occur, 4) Provide getDynStackPointer() API for lowering. Foundation for dynamic_stack_addr/load/store. Choose X19 as dyn_sp register (first callee-save). Critical infrastructure for alloca support.
