title: Check ARM64 ABI I128 requirements

close-reason: "Completed investigation. Result: Current abi.zig/regalloc_bridge.zig have NO I128 support. AAPCS64 requires consecutive register pairs (X0+X1). Gap analysis in /tmp/abi_i128_gap_analysis.md. Verdict: iconcat/isplit MVP NOT BLOCKED if we disallow I128 in function signatures; full ABI support needs ~200 LOC across abi/regalloc/call-lowering."

Files: ARM64 ABI spec, src/backends/aarch64/abi.zig. Oracle raised concern: ARM64 ABI requires I128 passed in register pairs (X0,X1) or (X2,X3), returned in (X0,X1), with aligned pair allocation. Questions: (1) Does current abi.zig handle I128? (2) Are consecutive register constraints enforced by regalloc? (3) Can iconcat/isplit work without regalloc understanding ValueRegs or will it cause incorrect code? Investigate: grep for I128 in abi.zig, check regalloc_bridge.zig for pair constraints, review ARM64 procedure call standard. Output: summary of current state + gap analysis. May block iconcat/isplit if ABI compliance missing.
