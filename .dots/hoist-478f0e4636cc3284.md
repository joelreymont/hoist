File: src/backends/aarch64/inst.zig + inst.isle + emit.zig + lower.isle - MAJOR WORK: Implementing AMode addressing modes requires: (1) Create inst.isle with AMode enum (8+ variants), (2) Refactor ALL load/store instructions to use AMode not Value, (3) Implement emission for each AMode variant, (4) Add amode constructor with 20+ optimization rules. This is architectural change affecting ~10+ files. Estimated: 1-2 weeks work. Should be planned as separate major task, not incremental addition.
