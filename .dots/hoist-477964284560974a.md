File: multiple test files - 28 compilation errors

Known errors:
- context.zig (3 errors): Function API mismatches
- isle_ctx.zig (2 errors): RegClass type mismatches  
- jump_table_data.zig (3 errors): BlockCall.new requires ValueListPool
- ssa_tests.zig (3 errors): PrimaryMap.getOrDefault missing
- backend.zig (2 errors): MoveInfo type mismatches
- dce.zig (1 error): enum literal in switch
- domtree.zig (1 error): pointer dereference issue
- Writer.zig (1 error): ambiguous format string

These are test-only errors that don't affect the main build. Systematic fixes needed for each category.
