File: src/backends/aarch64/lower.isle:898 - Our ISLE uses custom syntax like (<= 0 val 4095) which isn't valid ISLE. Cranelift uses 'extern extractor' for complex logic implemented in Rust/Zig. Need to: 1) Replace inline comparisons with extern extractors, 2) Implement extractors in isle_helpers.zig, 3) Match Cranelift's pattern of 'extern extractor infallible'. This blocks ISLE→Zig codegen.
