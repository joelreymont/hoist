File: src/codegen/compile.zig:466-484 - After try_call lowering, emit conditional branch to exception_successor. Implementation: (1) Get exception_successor and normal_successor from try_call_data, (2) Look up VCode block indices from ir_to_vcode_blocks, (3) Emit conditional branch instruction based on exception ABI check, (4) Emit unconditional branch/fallthrough to normal_successor. Depends on hoist-44ba1daa869bf3f9 (exception ABI definition).
