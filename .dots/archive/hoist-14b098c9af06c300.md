E2E tests hang with infinite loops consuming 100% CPU. Issue is in generated lowering code runtime behavior, not compilation. Tests affected: e2e_branches, e2e_loops, e2e_jit. Need to debug which instruction lowering is causing the loop. Likely candidates: branch handling, jump lowering, or register allocation issues in generated code.
