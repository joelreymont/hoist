File: src/codegen/compile.zig - During emitAArch64WithAllocation(), need to bind MachLabels for each VCode block start and call buffer.registerBlockLabel() with corresponding IR block. This requires: 1) Track IR→VCode block mapping (already done via ir_to_vcode_blocks HashMap), 2) Create/bind label at start of each VCode block emission, 3) Register mapping in MachBuffer for later offset queries in LSDA generation.
