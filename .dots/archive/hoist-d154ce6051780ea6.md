File: src/backends/aarch64/isle_impl.zig:1903 - After marshaling args and popping frame, emit BR (not BLR) to target. Target function will do the return for us. For return_call_indirect, load function pointer into temp register first. Must preserve return address in LR for target's eventual RET. Part of hoist-47cc3973f3c9bd63.
