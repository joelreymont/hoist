File: src/backends/aarch64/inst_encoding_test.zig (~200 lines). Unit test instruction encoding without full emission. Test: add/sub imm12, add/sub shifted reg, mul, load/store with offset, br/ret, mov. Each test: create Inst → encode → verify bytes match expected. Uses Inst.encode() directly. No regalloc/emission needed.
