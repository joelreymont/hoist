File: src/backends/aarch64/isle_impl.zig - Add ISLE constructor recognizing splat(load(addr)) pattern and lowering to LD1R. This avoids generating separate LDR + DUP instructions. Pattern match on vector splat with load operand, emit single LD1R. Verify address is valid for LD1R constraints. Depends on hoist-bcefcbdd257212ff.
