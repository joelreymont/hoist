close-reason: "Plan was incomplete - oracle review found fundamental design gaps. Replaced with investigation dots: multi-result infrastructure, ValueRegs bridge design, ABI compliance check."

Files: src/backends/aarch64/lower.isle, src/backends/aarch64/regalloc_bridge.zig - Add iconcat lowering: allocate consecutive VRegs (X0+X1), construct i128 register pair - Add isplit lowering: take i128 pair, extract to two i64 VRegs - Extend regalloc_bridge.zig to support register pair constraints (consecutive allocation) - Accept: iconcat/isplit use register pairs, regalloc enforces consecutive allocation - Depends: 'Add type conversion InstructionData variants'
