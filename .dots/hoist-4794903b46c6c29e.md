Cranelift defines runtime libcalls in ~/Work/wasmtime/cranelift/codegen/src/ir/libcall.rs:1-129 and known symbols in ir/known_symbol.rs:6-31; Hoist IR has no LibCall/KnownSymbol enums. Root cause: missing IR types for runtime call indirections. Fix: add enums and signature helpers, integrate with extfunc/global-value lookup and lowering for ops that require libcalls.
