File: src/generated/aarch64_lower_generated.zig add to .int_compare/.int_compare_imm
Opcodes: icmp (compare registers), icmp_imm (compare with immediate)
Implementation (~60 lines each - condition code mapping):
- icmp: Get operands + condition code, emit cmp_rr, emit cset with mapped condition
- icmp_imm: Same but cmp_imm instruction
- Need: Map IntCC (eq, ne, slt, sle, ...) → ARM64 CondCode (eq, ne, lt, le, ...)
Dependencies: None
Estimated: 1 day
Test: Test all comparison conditions
