File: src/regalloc/linear_scan.zig - Add StackSlotAllocator to reuse spill slots for non-interfering vregs. Current: Each spilled vreg gets unique slot (wasteful). Better: Track slot liveness, reuse freed slots. Algorithm: 1) Map slots to live ranges, 2) In allocateSpillSlot(), find first slot not live at current point, 3) Reuse or allocate new. Reduces stack frame size. Performance optimization.
