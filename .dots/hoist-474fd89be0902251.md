src/backends/aarch64/inst.zig (~3.5k LOC)

Port from: cranelift/codegen/src/isa/aarch64/inst/mod.rs

aarch64 Inst enum - ARM64 instruction variants:

Data processing:
- AluRRR (add, sub, and, orr, eor)
- AluRRImm12 (add/sub with 12-bit immediate)
- AluRRImmLogic (and/orr with bitmask immediate)
- Shift, Extend operations

Memory:
- Load, Store (multiple widths, addressing modes)
- LoadP, StoreP (load/store pair)
- Adr, Adrp (PC-relative address)

Control:
- B (unconditional branch)
- CondBr (conditional)
- Bl (branch and link / call)
- Ret

SIMD/NEON:
- VecRRR (add, mul for vectors)
- VecMisc (unary operations)

Operand types:
- Reg, Imm12, ImmLogic, ImmShift
- AMode (base + offset, pre/post-index)
