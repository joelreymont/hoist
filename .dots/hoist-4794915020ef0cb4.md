Cranelift PCC facts in ir/pcc.rs:1-120, memory types in ir/memtype.rs:1-160, program points in ir/progpoint.rs:1-49, and dynamic types in ir/dynamic_type.rs:1-36; Hoist lacks these IR constructs. Root cause: PCC/memory-typing/dynamic-vector support not ported. Fix: add IR types, integrate with verifier and any lowerings that consume facts or dynamic vectors.
