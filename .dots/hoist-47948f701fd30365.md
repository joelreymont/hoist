Cranelift ISA builder/lookup in ~/Work/wasmtime/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/mod.rs:91-170 (and call_conv module) supports triple-based selection; Hoist only has TargetISA interface in src/target/isa.zig:12-68. Root cause: ISA builder/lookup not ported. Fix: implement lookup by target triple, add call_conv definitions, and thread ISA builders into Context/compile pipeline.
