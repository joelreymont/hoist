File: src/codegen/lower_aarch64.zig. Enhance iconst lowering with full immediate legalization: detect imm12 vs large constants, select MOVZ/MOVN based on value, use MOVK for multi-part constants (up to 4 MOVKs for 64-bit). Reference: Cranelift inst/mod.rs:108-204. Part of Phase 2 core functionality. Estimate: 2 days.
