File: src/codegen/lower_aarch64.zig. Enhance store lowering with address mode selection: immediate offset (scaled by size), register+register, register+extended (SXTW/UXTW), register+shifted (LSL). Pattern match IR to select optimal addressing mode. Reference: Cranelift lower.isle store patterns. Part of Phase 2 core functionality. Estimate: 2 days.
