File: src/backends/aarch64/encoding_property_test.zig (~150 lines). Use quickcheck (if available) or manual property testing for instruction encoding. Properties to test: (1) encode-decode round trip for reversible instructions, (2) instruction length is always 4 bytes (or multiple of 4 for multi-inst sequences), (3) invalid immediate ranges rejected, (4) register encoding preserves register class. Pattern from dixie: property tests with oracles. Look at how dixie uses quickcheck in vex_nanopass_test.zig.
