Cranelift ISA settings live in ~/Work/wasmtime/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/settings.rs:1-9 and isa/aarch64/settings.rs:1-9; Hoist x64/aarch64 ISA files (src/backends/x64/isa.zig:10-31, src/backends/aarch64/isa.zig:10-210) have no settings builder integration. Root cause: ISA-specific flags not ported. Fix: implement per-ISA Flags structs, connect to shared settings builder, and gate instruction availability (SSE/AVX/LSE/etc).
