File: src/backends/aarch64/inst.zig ~line 230 - Add CCMP (conditional compare register) and CCMN (conditional compare negative) instruction structs. Fields: src1:Reg, src2:Reg/imm, cond:CondCode, nzcv:u4 (flags to set if condition false). This is the foundation for conditional compare chains. Depends on hoist-64a72e5da6ffea0f parent task.
