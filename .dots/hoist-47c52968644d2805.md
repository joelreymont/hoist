File: src/backends/aarch64/abi_test.zig - Property tests for frame layout. Props: 1) frame_size always 16-byte aligned, 2) callee-saves fit in frame, 3) stack probe triggers >4KB, 4) frame pointer set for large frames, 5) dynamic SP allocated when enabled. Use quickcheck from ../dixie/src/util/quickcheck.zig for randomized frame configurations.
