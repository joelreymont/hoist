File: src/backends/aarch64/isle_helpers.zig - We declared extern extractors in lower.isle (uimm12, uimm16, valid_shift_imm, valid_rotl_imm, in_neg_uimm12_range, valid_ldr/str_imm_offset, valid_ldr/str_shift) but need to implement them. These replace the inline comparison expressions we removed. Each should return Option type or use Zig error handling. ~100 LOC total.
