File: src/compiler/pipeline.zig (new). Tie together: IR builder → regalloc → lowering → encoding → JIT execution. Struct CompilePipeline with compile(func: IRFunction) !JitMemory. Steps: (1) liveness analysis, (2) register allocation, (3) ISLE lowering, (4) instruction encoding, (5) emit to JIT memory. ~250 lines. Depends: IR builder (hoist-47c5a161b6b20bc3). Unblocks: e2e tests.
