title: Add SIMD vector InstructionData variants

closed-at: "2026-01-03T15:47:17.654482+02:00"
close-reason: Already completed - documented that SIMD ops use existing UnaryData for widening/lane/float ops, BinaryData for narrowing (2 inputs)

File: src/ir/instruction_data.zig - Extend variants: Unary for widening (swiden_*/uwiden_*), Binary for narrowing (snarrow/unarrow/uunarrow take 2 vectors), Unary for lane ops (scalar_to_vector/extract_vector/iadd_pairwise/fvpromote_low/fvdemote) - Accept: All vector opcodes have InstructionData variants - Depends: 'Add SIMD vector opcodes to IR'
