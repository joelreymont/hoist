close-reason: Deferred - differential fuzzing requires dual backends
---

Create fuzzing harness: random IR generation, differential testing (x64 vs aarch64), crash detection, regression tests. Depends on: context (hoist-474df21d4c7514df), both backends (hoist-474def802eb47f86, hoist-474df16ff3bf7f10). Files: fuzz/ir_generator.zig, fuzz/differential.zig, fuzz/harness.zig. Find backend bugs automatically. QUALITY: Continuous validation!
