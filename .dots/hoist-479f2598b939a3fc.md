File: Create src/codegen/ranges.rs from cranelift/codegen/src/ranges.rs:1-80. Implements integer range analysis for optimization. Tracks min/max bounds of values, used for optimization decisions. Root cause: value range tracking missing. Fix: Port Range struct with intersection/union operations, integrate with constant propagation.
