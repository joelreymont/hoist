File: src/backends/aarch64/abi.zig:~600 (computeCalleeSaves). PreserveAll: callee saves ALL GPRs except arg registers and stack pointer. Save X0-X30 except args (X0-X7), save V0-V31 except args (V0-V7). Large prologue/epilogue. Used for statepoints/patchpoints in GC. ~60 lines in computeCalleeSaves. Test: verify all non-arg registers saved/restored. Depends: CallConv enum (hoist-47c59c479e51fe45).
