File: Create src/codegen/data_value.zig from cranelift/codegen/src/data_value.rs:1-120. DataValue represents constant values (integers, floats, vectors) for constant pools and initialization. Used in constant emission and pooling. Root cause: constant representation missing. Fix: Port DataValue enum with methods to convert to/from bytes.
