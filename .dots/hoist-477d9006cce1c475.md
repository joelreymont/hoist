File: src/backends/aarch64/inst.zig - Need: DUP (scalar_to_vector), INS/MOV (extract_vector lane 0), EXT (extract_vector high lanes), ADDP (iadd_pairwise) - Est: ~100-150 LOC for instruction structs, fmt, emit, dispatch - Also need: ExtractLaneData in instruction_data.zig (DONE) - Then: Add ISLE lowering rules in lower.isle (~50-80 LOC) - Accept: scalar_to_vector, extract_vector, iadd_pairwise ops compile to ARM64 NEON
