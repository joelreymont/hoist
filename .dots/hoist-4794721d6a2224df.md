Compare Cranelift module list (~/Work/wasmtime/cranelift/codegen/src/lib.rs:43-103) against Hoist exports (src/root.zig:1-154) and backend inst coverage (src/backends/x64/inst.zig:12-94 vs ~/Work/wasmtime/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/inst/*) to identify missing subsystems/instructions; root cause is missing ports/wiring in Hoist; fix by adding equivalent Zig modules and hooking into root.zig/pipeline, then verify with build/tests.
