File: src/backends/aarch64/lower.isle - BLOCKED: bmask requires lower_bmask helper with csetm (conditional set mask) instruction. Converts boolean to vector mask (-1 for true, 0 for false). Needs: (1) csetm instruction support, (2) lower_bmask with 4 variant rules for I8/I16/I32/I64/I128 inputs. Cranelift:2064, inst.isle:4959-5005. Used for conditional vector operations.
