File: src/backends/aarch64/e2e_return_test.zig (new). Test return value handling: int return in X0, float in V0, multi-return (struct) in X0+X1 or memory. Build IR with various return types, compile, execute, verify returned values. Test void return. ~70 lines. Depends: pipeline (hoist-47c5a1d26d09f085).
