closed-at: "2026-01-03T15:47:09.711540+02:00"
close-reason: Already completed - added AtomicLoadData, AtomicStoreData, AtomicRmwData, AtomicCasData, FenceData in instruction_data.zig with AtomicOrdering and AtomicRmwOp fields
---

File: src/ir/instruction_data.zig - Add new variants with ordering fields: AtomicLoad {opcode, flags, addr, ordering}, AtomicStore {opcode, flags, addr, src, ordering}, AtomicRmw {opcode, flags, addr, src, op, ordering}, AtomicCas {opcode, flags, addr, expected, replacement, ordering}, Fence {opcode, ordering} - Reference AtomicOrdering/AtomicRmwOp in src/ir/atomics.zig - Accept: All atomic opcodes have variants with ordering - Depends: 'Add atomic operation opcodes to IR'
