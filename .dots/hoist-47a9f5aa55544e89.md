File: src/backends/aarch64/abi.zig. Apple ARM64 vs standard AAPCS64. Differences: (1) X18 reserved on Apple (platform register), (2) no red zone on Apple. Calling convention variants: C (default), Fast (optimize register usage), PreserveAll (save all), Cold (rarely executed). Dependencies: platform detection. Effort: 1-2 days.
