File: src/generated/aarch64_lower_generated.zig modify call lowering
Need: Spill live caller-saved registers before call, restore after
Implementation: Better approach - let regalloc handle via operand constraints (mark call as clobbering caller-saved in operand extraction)
Dependencies: First call dot, call operand extraction from regalloc phase
Estimated: 1 day
Test: Test with live values across call
