File: src/codegen/compile.zig - 5 errors for missing infrastructure: 1) VCodeBuilder doesn't exist in machinst/vcode.zig, 2) TypeLegalizer.legalizeType() method missing, 3) BranchData.destination field missing, 4) Context.vcode field missing, 5) ArrayList(Block).init needs allocator. These are stubs for unimplemented codegen features.
