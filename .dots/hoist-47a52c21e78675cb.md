After fixing emit.zig imports, run 'zig build test --summary all' and verify: (1) e2e_loops.zig compiles, (2) e2e_branches.zig compiles, (3) e2e_jit.zig compiles, (4) 396/397 tests pass (1 expected JIT failure). If any test breaks, debug import issues. Document successful test run in commit message.
