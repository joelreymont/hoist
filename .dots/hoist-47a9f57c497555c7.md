File: src/codegen/lower_aarch64.zig. Opcodes: f16const, f32const, f64const, f128const. Instructions: FMOV immediate (8-bit encoded values: ±0.0, ±1.0, ±2.0, etc.) or LDR literal (from literal pool). Literal pool: allocate pool, manage 1MB max offset, deduplicate constants, alignment. Dependencies: code layout. Effort: 2-3 days.
