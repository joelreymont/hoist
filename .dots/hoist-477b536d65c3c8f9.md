File: src/ir/verifier.zig - Add validation: source→dest type compatibility (sextend widens, ireduce narrows, fpromote f32→f64 only, fdemote f64→f32 only), trap conversions validate overflow-prone sizes, iconcat/isplit type constraints (i64+i64→i128, i128→i64+i64) - Accept: Verifier catches invalid conversions - Depends: 'Add type conversion InstructionData variants'
