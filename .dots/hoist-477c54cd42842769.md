File: src/codegen/optimize.zig:57-63 - PROBLEM: 9 complete passes exist but only DCE registered! - Passes NOT registered: GVN (gvn.zig:283 LOC), InstCombine (instcombine.zig:380 LOC), Strength (strength.zig:188 LOC), Peephole (peephole.zig:282 LOC), CopyProp (copyprop.zig:150 LOC), LICM (licm.zig:296 LOC), SimplifyBranch (simplifybranch.zig:153 LOC) - Just add pass.run() calls (~10 LOC) - Infrastructure READY: CFG, domtree, loops all working - Accept: All passes execute in compile.zig pipeline
