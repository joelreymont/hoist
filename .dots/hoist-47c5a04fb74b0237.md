File: src/backends/aarch64/frame_layout_test.zig (new). Test frame_size calculation: (1) empty frame = 0, (2) locals + alignment, (3) callee-saves + locals, (4) large frame >4KB forces FP, (5) dynamic alloca forces FP+X19. Use MockABI to avoid full pipeline. ~100 lines. Depends: MockABI (hoist-47c59ffe5d59dbeb).
