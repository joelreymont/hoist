File: src/backends/aarch64/isle_helpers.zig - Add extractor that validates rotate-left immediate is valid for AArch64. Similar constraints to shift immediates. For 32-bit: 0-31, for 64-bit: 0-63. Returns the value if valid, null otherwise. Used in ISLE rotate rules. Signature: pub fn valid_rotl_imm(ty: Type, val: u64) ?u64
