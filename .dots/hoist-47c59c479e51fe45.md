File: src/machinst/abi.zig, new CallConv enum. Add to ABICallee/ABICaller structs. Variants: C (default AAPCS64), Fast (aggressive register usage, caller-save volatile regs), PreserveAll (save all GPRs/FPRs except args), Cold (mark rarely executed, de-prioritize for optimization). Field: callconv: CallConv in ABICallee. ~30 lines. Blocks: X18 reservation, calling convention tests.
