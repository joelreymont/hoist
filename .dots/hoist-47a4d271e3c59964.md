File: src/codegen/compile.zig:415-449 - Extend lowerInstructionAArch64 to handle iadd (add registers) and return instructions. This will enable simple functions like 'return 42' or 'add two numbers' to compile. Steps: (1) Add iadd case that emits add_rr instruction, (2) Add return case that emits ret instruction, (3) Handle instruction operands/results properly. These are the minimum instructions needed for basic E2E test.
