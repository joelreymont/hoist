File: src/codegen/lower_aarch64.zig. Opcodes: stack_load, stack_store, stack_addr. Address stack frame slots (SP/FP + offset). VERIFY: Are these already covered by existing load/store dot, or do they need separate handling? If separate: implement frame-relative addressing. Dependencies: stack frame layout. Effort: 1 day (if separate).
