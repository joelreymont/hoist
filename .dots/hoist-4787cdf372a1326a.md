Tested Cranelift ISLE compiler with Zig backend. Result: RED (stop signal per oracle criteria). Evidence: 1) Generated code is only 12-line stub, 2) Cranelift's prelude.isle has 68 type errors (Imm64, IntCC, etc. undefined), 3) codegen_zig.rs exists but generates minimal boilerplate only. Oracle was correct: ISLE→Zig needs 2-4 weeks of compiler work, not days. Recommendation: Either invest in completing codegen_zig.rs OR use FFI to Cranelift OR continue manual ISLE with our Zig helpers. Next: Decide on strategy - see /tmp/inst_specs_generated.zig for current codegen output.
