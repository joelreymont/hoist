File: src/backends/aarch64/isle_helpers.zig ~400-450 - CRITICAL GAP: Helpers declared (lower.isle:856-872) but NOT implemented - Need: aarch64_ldadd, aarch64_ldclr, aarch64_ldeor, aarch64_ldset, aarch64_ldsmax, aarch64_ldsmin, aarch64_ldumax, aarch64_ldumin, aarch64_swpal, aarch64_casal (~40-50 LOC) - Must handle AtomicOrdering → select acquire/release variant - Accept: atomic_rmw operations lower to LSE instructions
