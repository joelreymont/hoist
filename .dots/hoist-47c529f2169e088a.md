File: src/regalloc/linear_scan_test.zig - Property tests for register allocation. Props: 1) No two live vregs assigned same preg, 2) Spilled vregs have unique or reused slots, 3) Hints respected when register available, 4) All vregs get assignment (preg or spill). Use quickcheck to generate random live range configurations. Verify interference graph correctness.
