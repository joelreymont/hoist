File: src/codegen/lower_aarch64.zig. Add logic to detect ARM64 logical immediates (repeating bit patterns) for AND/ORR/EOR instructions. Implement bitmask encoding algorithm. Fall back to MOVZ+register op if not encodable. Reference: Cranelift immediates.rs. Part of Phase 2 core functionality. Estimate: 1 day.
