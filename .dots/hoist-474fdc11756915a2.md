fuzz/ infrastructure

Fuzzing strategy:

IR generation:
- Random valid IR functions
- Mutation-based from seeds
- Grammar-guided generation

Differential fuzzing:
- Generate IR
- Compile with Zig port
- Compile with Rust Cranelift
- Compare: crash, output bytes, execution

Crash detection:
- ASAN/MSAN builds
- Undefined behavior detection
- Assertion failures

Targets:
- fuzz/fuzz_compile.zig
- fuzz/fuzz_isle.zig
- fuzz/fuzz_regalloc.zig

Goal: 1M iterations with no crashes
