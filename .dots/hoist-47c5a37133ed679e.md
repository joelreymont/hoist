File: src/backends/aarch64/e2e_stack_align_test.zig (new). Test AAPCS64 16-byte stack alignment: (1) entry SP % 16 == 0, (2) after call SP % 16 == 0, (3) large frames aligned. Use inline asm to read SP, verify alignment. Test odd-sized locals forcing padding. Test dynamic alloca maintains alignment. ~80 lines. Depends: pipeline (hoist-47c5a1d26d09f085).
