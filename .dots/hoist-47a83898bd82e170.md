title: Create standalone E2E test executable

close-reason: "COMPLETE - Revealed root cause: redundant 'mov w0,w0' generated, function returns 0. Generated code: 'movz w0,#42; mov w0,w0; ret' (12 bytes, should be 8). Issue is in IR lowering generating extra mov_rr."

File: Create new standalone executable (not test) that compiles 'fn() -> i32 { return 42; }' using our compiler, prints generated machine code bytes, executes JIT code, prints result. Bypasses test framework hang. Will reveal if instruction encoding or IR generation is the bug. Priority: CRITICAL for diagnosis.
