File: build.zig:236-251 - ISLE compilation step is commented out. Need to uncomment IsleCompileStep.create() and wire up isle_compiler to generate .zig from .isle specs. Currently src/generated/*.zig files are stubs. Generates lower_generated.zig, aarch64_lower_generated.zig, opts_generated.zig from src/backends/{aarch64,x64}/lower.isle and src/dsl/isle/opts.isle.
