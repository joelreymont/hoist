File: src/backends/aarch64/abi.zig:~500 (computeRegs). Check if platform == .Darwin, mark X18 as system-reserved. X18 is Apple's platform register, must never be allocated. In computeRegs: if (callee.platform == .Darwin) exclude X18 from available_gprs BitSet. Add unit test verifying X18 not in allocation pool on Darwin. ~15 lines code, ~20 lines test. Depends: Platform enum (hoist-47c59c95d112fb5e).
